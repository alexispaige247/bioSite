            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Timothy Mitchell, known to most as Tim, grew up in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, where he developed the values of hard work and balance that continue to shape his life today. Now 56 years old, Tim lives in Las Vegas with his wife, where he works as a poker dealer at the Venetian. While the city thrives on fast-paced energy, Tim makes it a point to stay grounded through his hobbies, family, and personal goals.</p>
                <p>Bowling and pool have been lifelong interests for Tim, giving him both relaxation and moments of pride. One of his favorite memories comes from the BCA World Championships, where he placed second. During the event, he pulled off a memorable jump shot that sank both the 1 and the 9 ball on the break, instantly winning the first match. The shot was caught live on stream, and he proudly brought home a trophy for winning second place. His wife, who is now a tournament director in the pool community, has been an active source of encouragement throughout his journey, while his grown children often join him for games and show their support.</p>
                <p>Above all, Tim values family. He considers raising three hardworking adult children to be his greatest accomplishment, and now cherishes time with his grandchild. Inspired by his father’s example of balancing work with enjoyment, Tim strives to live the same way—dedicating time to his hobbies, maintaining family traditions like Sunday gatherings, and setting goals for the future. Looking ahead, Tim hopes to continue staying healthy, active, and eventually transition into dealing live poker tables. For him, life is about cherishing the present, celebrating small victories, and never sweating the small stuff.</p>
